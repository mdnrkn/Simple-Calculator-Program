# Simple Calculator Program

This is a simple calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user for input, performs the calculation based on the operator entered, and then displays the result.

## Getting Started

To use this calculator, you will need Python installed on your computer. Once you have Python installed, simply copy and paste the code into a Python file, save it, and then run the file.

## Usage

When you run the file, you will be prompted to enter an operator (+, -, *, /) and two numbers. The program will then perform the calculation based on the operator entered and display the result.

If you enter an invalid operator, the program will display an error message and exit. If you attempt to divide by zero, the program will also display an error message and exit.
